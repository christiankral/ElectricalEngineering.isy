# Purpose

The file `styles/ElectricalEngineering.isy` provides electrical engineering circuits components for
[IPE](http://ipe.otfried.org/). The additional customization file `ipelets/customize.lua` enables the following additional shortcuts:

- `Shift+S` to add symbols
- `Alt+Ctrl+I` to add splines

**German instructions** on installing and using Ipe can be found [here](https://gitea.com/christiankral/Ipe_Anleitung).

# Installation

## Linux

### Styles file

Copy the styles file `styles/ElectricalEngineering.isy` into the user directory `~/.ipe/styles/` (`styles` may have have to be created first). You can either do these steps manually or use this script:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ipe/styles
cd ~/.ipe/styles
rm ElectricalEngineering.isy
wget https://github.com/christiankral/ElectricalEngineering.isy/raw/master/styles/ElectricalEngineering.isy
```

### Customization file

Copy the customization file `ipelets/customize.lua` into the user directory `~/.ipe/ipelets/` (`ipelets` may have have to be created first). You have to [change](https://github.com/christiankral/ElectricalEngineering.isy/issues/1)

`prefs.styles = { "/path/to/ElectricalEngineering.isy" }`

to the **absolute** path

`prefs.styles = { "/home/user/.ipe/styles/ElectricalEngineering.isy" }`

(where `user` is your user name). You can either do these steps manually or use this script:

```bash
# Download, copy and configure customize.lua
mkdir -p ~/.ipe/ipelets/
cd ~/.ipe/ipelets/
rm customize.lua
wget https://github.com/christiankral/ElectricalEngineering.isy/raw/master/ipelets/customize.lua
sed -i 's@~@'"$HOME"'@g' customize.lua
```

## Windows

We are assuming that [IPE](http://ipe.otfried.org/) is installed in `C:\bin\Ipe`; but it may be installed somewhere else.

### Styles file

Copy the styles file `styles/ElectricalEngineering.isy` into the Windows directory `C:\bin\Ipe\styles\` (`styles` may have have to be created first)

### Customization file

Copy the customization file `ipelets/customize.lua` into the user directory `C:\bin\Ipe\ipelets\` (`ipelets` may have have to be created first). You have to [change](https://github.com/christiankral/ElectricalEngineering.isy/issues/1)

`prefs.styles = { "/path/to/ElectricalEngineering.isy" }`

to (note the double backslashes)

`prefs.styles = { "C:\\bin\\Ipe\\styles\\ElectricalEngineering.isy" }`

# Version handling

Ipe files created with ElectricalEngineering versions before and after v0.5.0 are not compatible.

Older files can be updated under Linux using the script `Resources/update1.sh`.
This script inserts an updated version of ElectricalEngineering.isy into an ipe file and
fixes compatibility issues caused be new component names. If you encounter any conversion problems, please file an issue.

This script converts one or more Ipe file to ElectricalEngineering version v1.X.X.

## Conversion Examples

- `update1.sh File.ipe` updates `File.ipe` by inserting `~/.ipe/styles/ElectricalEngineering.isy`
- `update1.sh "*.ipe"` updates all files `*.ipe` by inserting `~/.ipe/styles/ElectricalEngineering.isy`
- `update1.sh "*.ipe" /work/ElectricalEngineering.isy` updates all files `*.ipe` by inserting `/work/ElectricalEngineering.isy`

# Example

## Induction machine

- Stored in `Resources/InductionMachine.ipe`
